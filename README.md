For this project you will learn about the importance of good security by creating a password cracker to figure out passwords that were hashed using SHA-1.

Creating a function that takes in a SHA-1 hash of a password and returns the password if it is one of the top 10,000 passwords used. If the SHA-1 hash is NOT of a password in the database, it returns "PASSWORD NOT IN DATABASE".
